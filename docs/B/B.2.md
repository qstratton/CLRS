## B.2-1

> Prove that the sbset relation "$\subseteq$" on all subsets of $\mathbb{Z}$ is
> a partial order but not a total order.

(Omit!)

## B.2-2
> Show that for any positive integer $n$, the relation "equivalent modulo $n$"
> is an equivalence relation on the integers. (We say that $a\equiv b (\mod n)$
> if there exists an integer $q$ such that $a - b = qn$.) Into what equivalence
> classes does this relation partition the integers?

(Omit!)

## B.2-3

> Give examples of relations that are
>
> **a.** reflexive and symmetric but not transitive,
>
> **b.** reflexive and transitive but not symmetric,
>
> **c.** symmetric and transitive but not reflexive.

(Omit!)

## B.2-4

> Let $S$ be a finite set, and let $R$ be an equivalence relation on $S\times
> S$. Show that if in addition $R$ is antisymmetric, then the equivalence
> classes of $S$ with respect to $R$ are singletons.

(Omit!)

## B.2-5

> Professor Narcissus claims that if a relation $R$ is symmetric and transitive,
> then it is also reflexive. he offers the following proof. By symmetry,
> $a\,R\,b$ implies $b\,R\,a$. Transitivity, therefore, implies $a\,R\,a$. Is
> the professor correct?
