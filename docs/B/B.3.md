# B.3-2

> Is the function $f(x) = x + 1$ bijective when the domain and codomain are
> $\mathbb{N}$? Is it bijective when the domain and codomain are $\mathbb{Z}$?

(Omit!)

# B.3-3

> Give a natural definition for the inverse of a binary relation such that if a
> relation is in fact a bijective function, its relational inverse is its
> functional inverse.

## B.3-4

> Give a bijection from $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$.
