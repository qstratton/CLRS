## B.5-1

> Draw all the free trees composed of the three vertices $x$, $y$ and $z$. Draw
> all the rooted trees with nodes $x$, $y$, ad $z$ with $x$ as the root. Draw
> all the ordered trees with nodes $x$, $y$, and $z$ with nodes $x$, $y$, and
> $z$ with $x$ as the root. Draw all the binary trees with nodes $x$, $y$, and
> $z$ with $x$ as the root.

## B.5-2

> Let $G = (V,E)$ be a directed acyclic graph in which there is a vertex $v_0\in
> V$ such that there exists a unique path from $v_0$ to every vertex $v\in V$.
> Prove that the undirected version of $G$ forms a tree.

(Omit!)

## B.5-3

> Show by induction that the number of degree-2 nodes in any nonempty binary
> tree is 1 fewer than the number of leaves. Conclude that the number of
> internal nodes in a full binary tree is 1 fewer than the number of leaves.

## B.5-4

> Use induction to show that a nonempty binary tree with $n$ nodes has height at
> least $\lfloor \lg n \rfloor$.
