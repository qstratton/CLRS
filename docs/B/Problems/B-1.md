## B-1 Graph coloring

> Given an undirected graph $G = (V,E)$, a **_k-coloring_** of $G$ is a function
> $c: V\to \\{0,1,\ldots,k-1\\}$ such that $c(u)\neq c(v)$ for every edge
> $(u,v)\in E$. In other words, the numbers $0,1,\ldots,k-1$ represent the $k$
> colors, and adjacent vertices must have different colors.
>
> **a.** Show that any tree is 2-colorable.
>
> **b.** Show that the following are equivalent:
>
> 1. $G$ is bipartite.
> 2. $G$ is 2-colorable.
> 3. $G$ has no cycles of odd length.
>
> **c.** Let $d$ be the maximum degree of any vertex in a graph $G$. Prove that we can
> color $G$ with $d+1$ colors.
>
> **d.** Show that if $G$ has $O(|V|)$ edges, then we can color $G$ with
> $O(\sqrt{|V|})$ colors.
