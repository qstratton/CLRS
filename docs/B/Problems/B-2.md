>
> **b.** Every group of six people contains either at least three mutual friends
> or at least three mutual strangers.
>
> **c.** Any group of people can be partitioned into two subgroups such that at
> least half the friends of each person belong to the subgroup of which that
> person is _not_ a member.
> 
> **d.** If everyone in a group is the friend of at least half the people in the
