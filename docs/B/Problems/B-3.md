## B-3 Bisecting trees

> Many divide-and-conquer algorithms that operate on graphs require that the
> graph be bisected into two nearly equal-sized subgraphs, which are induced by
> a partition of the vertices. This problems investigates bisections of trees
> formed by removing a small number of edges. We require that whenever two
> vertices end up in the same subtree after removing edges, then they must be in
> the same partition.
>
> **a.** Show that we can partition the vertices of any $n$-vertex binary tree
> into two sets $A$ and $B$, such that $|A|\leq 3n/4$ and $|B|\leq 3n/4$, by
> removing a single edge.
>
> **b.** Show that the constant $3/4$ in part (a) is optimal in the worst case
> by giving an example of a simple binary tree whose most evenly balanced
> partition upon removal of a single edge has $|A| = 3n/4$.
>
> **c.** Show that by removing at most  $O(\lg n)$ edges, we can partition the vertices
> of any $n$-vertex binary tree into two sets $A$ and $B$ such that $|A| =
> \lfloor n/2\rfloor$ and $|B| = \lceil n/2 \rceil$.
